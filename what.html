            <p>Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) is a full gospel ministry devoted to the revival of apostolic signs, Holy Ghost fireworks, and the unlimited power of God to deliver to the uttermost. At Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries worldwide, absolute holiness within and without, as the greatest spiritual insecticide, and a condition for Heaven is taught openly. MFM is a do-it-yourself Gospel Ministry where your hands are trained to wage war and your fingers to fight.

                At MFM, aggressive prayer is considered as an aid to spiritual focus and a check against being overwhelmed by the flesh. At the MFM Prayer City, Prayer goes on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, non-stop.
                At MFM Middlesbrough, we Preach Salvation, Practice Holiness within and without, and Minister Deliverance. We believe that a sound Biblical Knowledge is a prerequisite for good Christian living. We also believe in bringing down the hand of God into our midst by Good Holy Ghost filled Praise and Worship</p>
        
        
            <p>The following are the Goals and Aims of The Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, as handed to the General Overseer:
            </p>
            <li>To propagate the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ all over the world
            </li>
            <li>To bring together children of God who are lost in dead churches</li>
            <li>To train believers in the art and science of spiritual warfare; thus, making them an aggressive and victorious army for the Lord
            </li>
            <li>To train believers to receive holy Ghost baptism and Fire as well as daily walk and relationship with the Holy Spirit</li>
            <li>To turn the joy of our enemies to sorrow. That is why we would always have a deliverance ministry wherever we are. If you do not believe in deliverance, you are not supposed to be in MFM</li>
            <li>To build an aggressive end-time army for the Lord. MFM is an end-time church where we build an aggressive end end-time army for the Lord. WHAT IS AN END-TIME CHURCH? It is a church where sinner enters with two options. He either repents or does not come back, contrary to the present-day Church where sinners are comfortable and find things so easy and convenient.
            </li>
            <li>To deliver those who have become slaves to Pastors, Prophets and Apostles</li>
            <li>To build up heavenly-bound and aggressive Christians. The priority in MFM is for people to make heaven. It is not a worldly Church</li>
            <li>To build up prayer eagles</li>
            <li>To purify the Pentecostal dirtiness of this age. </li>
